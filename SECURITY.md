# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions are supported, but it's recommended to stay on the always current version.
There may be known vulnerabilities in development dependencies that are avoidable.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x+    | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities from version updates should have automated PRs from dependabot.

If there is a vulnerability in the code itself, please submit an issue (or also a PR if you have the solution), mentioning the vulnerability.
